# Stunting Prevalence Classification

## Project Overview
Malnutrition is still a major problem in infants and children under five years old globally, especially in Indonesia. Stunting is also one of the main nutrition problems in children in Indonesia that has not been resolved. The Ministry of Health (2020) states that the prevalence of stunting in Indonesia is targeted to continue to decrease to 14% by 2024. This study aims to compare the Extra Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees) and Random Forest methods for the classification of stunting prevalence in regencies / cities in Indonesia. This research is expected to provide information and suggestions for the government and public to continue to overcome the stunting problem in Indonesia.

## Project Goals
The purpose of this study is to determine the variables that contribute most to the classification of stunting prevalence in regencies/cities in Indonesia and compare the performance of the Extra Trees and Random Forest methods in classifying stunting prevalence in regencies/cities in Indonesia based on accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-Score values.

## Project Results

**Descriptive Statistics**

The figure shows a map of the distribution of stunting prevalence in districts/cities in Indonesia. The stunting prevalence categories are marked with 5 different colors. 	The very low stunting prevalence category is marked in blue, the low category is marked in yellow, the medium category is marked in green, the high category is marked in pink, and the very high category is marked in purple. Based on the above, it can be seen that the stunting prevalence category of most districts/cities in Indonesia is low. This is indicated by the dominance of yellow color on the distribution map of stunting prevalence in regencies/cities in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the very high stunting prevalence category is the category that occurs in the least number of districts/cities in Indonesia. This is indicated by the few purple colors on the distribution map of stunting prevalence in districts/cities in Indonesia.
Overall, the number of districts/cities with low and very low stunting prevalence categories is greater than the number of districts/cities with medium, high, and very high prevalence categories. However, there is still a need to reduce the stunting incidence in each district/city.

**Random Forest**

Based on the results of the confusion matrix, the accuracy value is 54%, the precision value is 40%, the recall value is 43%, the specificity value is 83%, and the F1-Score is 42%.
The predictor variables that have the greatest importance in classifying the prevalence of stunting in regencies/cities in Indonesia are the Adjusted Per Capita Expenditure variables with the highest importance with a Mean Decrease Gini value of 0,21851. This indicates that the variable is the variable that has the highest level of importance in the formation of the Extra Trees model.

Based on the results of the confusion matrix, the accuracy value is 55%, the precision value is 51%, the recall value is 49%, the specificity value is 83%, and the F1-Score is 49%.
The predictor variables that have the greatest importance in classifying the prevalence of stunting in regencies/cities in Indonesia are the Adjusted Per Capita Expenditure variables with the highest importance with a Mean Decrease Gini value of 0,22963. This indicates that the variable is the variable that has the highest level of importance in the formation of the Extra Trees model.

## Project Conclusions and Recommendations

**Conclusions**

1.	The predictor variable that gives the most importance or contribution to the classification of stunting prevalence in regencies / cities in Indonesia using both the Extra Trees and Random Forest methods is Adjusted Per Capita Expenditure.
2.	Based on the results of the comparison of the accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1¬-Score values of the two models produced by the Extra Trees and Random Forest methods, it was found that the model generated by the Extra Trees method had better performance for classifying the prevalence of stunting in regencies / cities in Indonesia because it produced higher accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1¬-Score values.

**Recommendations**

1.	To obtain better classification results, further research is expected to add other predictor variables related to stunting such as Exclusive Breastfeeding History, Family Food Security, Family Income, and etc.
2.	Using other combined methods to obtain classification results such as combined methods with boosting methods that have the advantage of producing low errors by working repeatedly to correct previous model errors so that a strong model is obtained. Another method that can be used is the stacking method, which has the advantage of improving prediction performance by combining several types of classification models. In addition, classifiers that fit the data can be determined in advance.
